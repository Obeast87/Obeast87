- 👋 Hi, I’m @Obeast87
- 👀 I’m interested in programming for a career in the tech industry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python 3.9 self-taught (soon to be 3.10 once that's out).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... I dunno? I'm still learning.
- 📫 How to reach me ... On here if possible via DMs or PMs.
- I'm also not a super great programmer, but if you see potential
- in what I've written and tossed on here as a beginner-ish programmer, please let me know.
